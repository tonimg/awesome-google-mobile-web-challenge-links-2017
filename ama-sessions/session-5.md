#### I am a college student and I was preparing and taking my final exams for a long time. So far my progress in the course is about 35%, however after the final exam is over (9th of Jan) I will be having about 2-3 weeks where I am free completely for understanding and finalizing the course. Now the question is, Is this situation going to affect my advancing to phase 2 negatively or not? From the previous AMAs, I got that you measure the time spent on each lesson, however does that mean that you measure the time where I am actively working on the udacity resources, or just the time spent to advance from one lesson to another regardless of active time. Also, there is a point related to that which is not clear to me. You said that you measure our contribution to the forum and slack. However, since I am quite late compared to the average most of the questions I can answer are answered 10 times already. Also, I don’t have questions, because whenever I have one the forum has a lot of people with the same problem and their answers in replies. The point is, do you measure replies and posts, or simple interactions with likes and upvotes are enough without adding more will suffice?
There is still a month left in the program and that means there is more than enough time for you to go through the course and to be active online. In pervious scholarships, we’ve seen many student really give it their all in the final months and continue on to the next phase. There is still time for you and everyone else who may be worrying about if it’s too late to really make the most of this first phase. Re: your main question, we measure all of your activity on the forum from replies to topics posted to likes and upvotes, but we also don’t only pass people with A LOT of forum activity, we have many many metrics to take into consideration when the selection process comes as we take into consideration some people have more time than others. Best of luck with your exams :smile:

#### The other day I saw somebody posting an issue in one of the tasks. Will you (udacity) act, when this kind of information comes in over slack or should we report it somewhere else?
It would be best to go to “Report An Issue” directly in the classroom and send your message there. This way you will reach the team responsible for the particular task directly.

#### Hello everyone, The answer at this question might already exist but I can’t find it. I don’t use Slack much (Only for the meet study buddies program) but I’m an active user on the forum. Is it a problem to go to the next phase ?
In short: no. There are a large number of students who only use the forum, and there are students who prefer Slack. This is why we measure and monitor both communities. At the end of the day, the two are not equal and forum activity is more important than Slack when it comes to the metrics we analyze.

#### i wonder how you will be choosing students for next phase?
Hey, the Scholarship Expectations are listed here: https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/udacitydevscholars17/home, at the very bottom of the page. Please visit this page every now and then, as it provides (and will be providing) the updates in the program.

#### Hi, will interaction on slack alone count, or do we need to use the forums? I prefer using Slack myself and haven’t registered on the forum. Happy to help out others
Your time on Slack certainly does count toward your application for the 2nd phase, but I also would encourage you to use the forum when you can. We have many many more metrics in place to measure activity on the forum than we do in Slack. There’s still a month left so there’s plenty of time to start posting on the forum :slightly_smiling_face:

#### for the new group, new_study_buddies, working with another member will be via sharing a git repository or live coding or communication via slack and other like skype…?
Donut is the bot on Slack that will randomly pair you with another user in slack. How the two of you choose to communicate is entirely up to you.

#### Hello! Will we know the february 6 if we pass or not to the next stage of the scholarship or will it take some time to know? After this, if we don’t get to the next stage, will this slack channel continue being open?
February 6th is your deadline, but the 6.000 scholarship recipients will be announced a little later. Don’t worry, all the important dates will be communicated to everyone later on! Slack channel and the Forums will stay open for app. 1 month.

#### Seems that most of the questions are related to how you evaluate the contributions needed to move on to the next phase of the program. I understand that there are various communication channels and tools available for students to contribute, and that giving out the exact description of the metrics you employ would be a bit of “cheating” (people would be focusing on maximizing their “impact score”). But on the other hand, the lack of specific evaluation guidelines also makes more difficult to keep track of what kinds of contributions are relevant for progression and which ones are not. Perhaps as a suggestion but also as a question, how much is the actual course progression and completion considered, when compared for instance to help provided to other students? And regarding the latter, do you differentiate between contributions related to the actual course contents and those ones which are not (e.g. side projects, ideas, suggestions, tech discussions, etc.)?
The most important thing we look at is course completion. If you haven’t achieved 100% in the material, then you’re automatically no longer in consideration for phase 2. We’re looking for 6,000 students at the end of the day to move to phase 2 and way more than 6,000 will finish their program by the time Feb 6th rolls around. This is where we bring in further metrics so we can continue to bring the number of recipients down to the desired 6,000. We measure everything that we can see on our Slack channels and forums. If you have side projects in private chats, or meet people offline, there’s no way for us to take that into consideration. I hope this answers your question in some way.

#### Hey, I’ve just finished the course, head scratching in parts 3 & 4. Will revising course content count towards time spent on the course or is additional time spent revising content not taken into consideration. Only ask because I might study other SW tutorials and getting a different perspective on it if revising doesn’t contribute.
We track the time you spend on the course but will never mark you down for spending too much time on a lesson or using extra time to revise. :slightly_smiling_face:

#### How many students finished the course so far? Is this piece of information allowed to be known? :smile:
Here’s some interesting information and, hopefully, also encouraging news. Out of 60k students, about 4k have 100% completed all of the course material. This is normal. And this means that you shouldn’t feel like it’s too late for you to enter the game as there is still many chances for you to step up and make it into phase 2. Tens of thousands more will finish the course this month and that sort of boils done to student nature. Something that many of us, myself included, is guilty of. In short, the door is wide open for a lot more of you to get to phase 2!!!

#### It looks like that forum is more preferable than slack and I didn’t know that :sob::joy: The #new_study_buddies channel looks promising but what about small tasks just to enrich our knowledge or ideas and we start brainstorming every Monday
We are always more than happy to welcome new ideas for channels here on slack :slightly_smiling_face: For collecting these we enabled #channels_requests, so feel free to “pitch” your idea there.

#### Do related courses like JavaScript Promises also contribute to evaluation? (Sorry, I know you’re tired of these evaluation questions).
It’s always great to see students doing extra work to build their knowledge, but the only things we take into consideration is the material offered within the Scholarship. :slightly_smiling_face:
